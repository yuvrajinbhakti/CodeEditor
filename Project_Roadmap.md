# Project Roadmap: Code Editor & Real-Time Collaboration

## **Phase 1: Code Editor Development**

### **Step 1: Project Setup**
- **Tasks**:
  - Initialize the project using Tauri and React.
  - Set up the necessary dependencies and project structure.
- **Deadline**: **Month 0-1**

### **Step 2: Monaco Editor Integration**
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate the Monaco Editor into the project.
  - Configure basic editor settings such as themes, syntax highlighting, and language support.
- **Deadline**: **Month 2**

### **Step 3: Basic Complier Functionality**
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement core text editing features like text input, compilation.
  - Test the basic Monaco Editor features to ensure proper functionality.
- **Deadline**: **Month 3**

## **Phase 2: Real-Time Collaboration Implementation**

### **Step 1: WebSocket Server and UI Setup**
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up the WebSocket server (Rust/Golang).
  - Add the frontend accordingly
- **Deadline**: **Month 4**

### **Step 2: WebSocket Client Integration**
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up the WebSocket client (React) to connect to the server and handle incoming and outgoing messages.
  - Test the client-server communication with sample data.
- **Deadline**: **Month 5**

### **Step 3: Real-Time Collaboration Features**
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement real-time collaboration by broadcasting changes from one user to others.
  - Ensure that changes are reflected across all clients in real-time, with minimal latency.
  - Implement features like user presence and cursor tracking to show who is editing and where and *complete the UI*.
- **Deadline**: **Monnth 6**

### **Step 4: Chat Room Functionality**
- **Tasks**:
  - Add chat functionality using WebSockets for real-time communication.
  - Set up a chat window where users can send messages while collaborating.
  - Ensure chat messages are synchronized across all users in the real-time environment.
- **Deadline**: **Month 7**

### **Step 5: Read/Write Access Permissions**
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement user authentication (sign up, login).
  - Set up roles for users (e.g., **admin**, **editor**, and **viewer**).
  - Implement **read/write access control** based on user roles (e.g., viewers can only see the code, while editors can make changes).
  - Ensure permissions are enforced in both the code editor and chat rooms.
- **Deadline**: **Month 8**

## **Phase 3: Enhancements and Finalization**

### **Step 1: Advanced Editor Features**
- **Tasks**:
  - Add advanced features such as syntax auto-completion, IntelliSense, themes, and file management (open, save, create new).
- **Deadline**: **Month 9**

### **Step 2: Debugging and Testing**
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct extensive testing of the editor’s functionality, especially for real-time collaboration features.
  - Ensure synchronization works without conflicts or lag.
  - Test edge cases such as network failure and recovery scenarios.
- **Deadline**: **Month 10**

### **Step 3: Final Deployment**
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up deployment infrastructure for hosting the WebSocket server and frontend code.
  - Deploy the project on a scalable hosting service (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
- **Deadline**: **Month 11**
