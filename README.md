### **Project Plan(Timeline has been added)**

### **Project Overview**
The Code Collab Project is a real-time code collaboration tool aimed at providing developers with a seamless environment for writing and sharing code. This tool integrates features like live code editing, real-time communication, and code versioning to facilitate team collaboration.

Our goal is to create an all-in-one IDE-like platform where developers can collaborate on projects with real-time feedback, making the development process smoother and more interactive.

---

## **Features**
- **Real-time code collaboration**: Multiple users can work on the same codebase with real-time syncing.
- **Built-in compiler**: Compile and run code directly from the platform.
- **Role-based access control**: Users have different access levels (read/write) depending on their role.
- **Version control**: Integrated version control system to manage code changes.
- **In-app communication**: Real-time chat functionality for seamless developer communication.

New Features

- Live Debugging Sessions: Enable users to debug code in real-time, sharing debugging sessions with team members for collaborative troubleshooting. Users can set breakpoints, step through code, and view variable states together.

- Code Suggestions and Autocomplete: Implement AI-powered code suggestions to improve productivity by providing intelligent autocompletion based on the code context and best practices.

- Pair Programming Mode: Introduce a pair programming feature that allows two developers to share control over the same coding session, encouraging collaborative problem-solving and mentoring.

- Code Review & Annotation: Add functionality for inline comments, reviews, and annotations. Team members can highlight code segments and provide feedback, helping to streamline the code review process.

- Real-time Code Preview: Provide instant previews of web applications (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) or mobile apps (React Native, Flutter) being built in the platform. This allows users to see the results of their changes immediately without leaving the collaboration environment.

- Task Management Integration: Integrate task management features like to-do lists, issue tracking, and project boards (e.g., Kanban) directly within the platform, allowing users to manage their tasks alongside the code.

- Third-party Integrations: Add integrations with popular developer tools such as GitHub, Jira, Slack, and Trello to allow seamless project management, version control, and communication.

- Voice and Video Calls: Embed voice and video call functionality to allow teams to have virtual meetings directly within the platform while collaborating on code.

- Code Quality Checks: Integrate static code analysis and linting tools to automatically check code for errors, maintain coding standards, and suggest improvements in real-time as the team writes code.

- Multi-language Support: Allow users to collaborate on projects in multiple programming languages with customizable syntax highlighting, language-specific compilers, and debugging tools.

- Time-travel Debugging: Introduce time-travel debugging, which allows users to step backward and forward in the execution of their code to see how it behaves over time.

- Custom Themes and Layouts: Provide customizable themes and layouts, enabling users to personalize their workspace for improved comfort and productivity.

## **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **Tauri**: A lightweight framework for building desktop applications using web technologies.
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Monaco Editor**: The code editor that powers Visual Studio Code, used for editing code in the browser.

### **Backend**
- **Rust**: For the core backend logic, ensuring performance and reliability.
- **Golang**: Used for microservices and handling certain server-side tasks.

### **Real-time Communication**
- **WebSocket**: Enables real-time communication between the frontend and backend, allowing for live collaboration and code updates.

### **Database**
- **Firebase**: Cloud database for managing user authentication and real-time data syncing.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management to boost performance.
